TinyTracker
===============

TinyTracker is an open source Arduino-based GPS tracking program. The intended use is the tracking of an amateur high altitude balloon.

At the moment it's not too "tiny" but the future focus will be on robustness and simplicity. The less complicated a program is, the less likely it is to crash. This is essential in embedded situations
that operate 35km(!) above sea level with no human interaction.
